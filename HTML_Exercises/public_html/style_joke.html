        Another dog joke</h1>
    <p>
        A wife says to her husband, "We've got such a clever dog. He brings in the newspapers every morning."</p>
    <p>
        Her husband replies, "Well, lots of dogs can do that."</p>
    <p>
        His wife responds, "But we've never subscribed to any!"</p>
