          Many moons ago an quiet dog decided to change the way he lived.   He was tired of being the quiet one and 
          watching other dogs gather.   So he decided to send out invitations to all the local dogs including one very 
          special dog, Freeda.  From puppies he and Freeda would play, go for long walks and explore new things.  But lately Freeda started
          showing less interest in these events and more in parties.</p>
          
        <p><img src="images/writing-invitations.jpg" alt="Writing an invitation" class="floatLeft"/> So he sat down to write the invitations. 
          He wrote them to all the dogs that he use to play with.  He wrote invitations to dogs that he barely new.  He sent 
          special invitations to his parents and twelve brothers and sisters.  But when it 
          came to Freeda's he made a special attempt at what he wrote.</p>
          
        <p class="textTop">
          He wrote, "If you get this invitation please let me know you got it with a sign."
               
       
          <a href="javascript:alert('I got it!');"> <img src="images/receive-invitations.jpg" alt="Click to let him know Freeda got it!"/></a></p>
